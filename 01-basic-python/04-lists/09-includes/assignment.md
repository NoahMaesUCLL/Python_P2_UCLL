# Assignment

Write a function `includes(xs, ys)` that checks whether all elements in `ys` also appear in `xs`.
The number of occurrences is unimportant.

Examples:

* `includes([1, 2, 3], [1, 2])` returns `True`.
* `includes([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4])` returns `False` because `4` is missing from `xs`.
* `includes([1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])` returns `True`: it is not necessary for `1` to occur as often in `xs` as in `ys`.
